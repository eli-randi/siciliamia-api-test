# Getting started:

## Server
Ensure MongoDB is installed - https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server - and running on port 27017

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

This should run the server on `localhost:3001`.

## Client

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

This should run the client development server on `localhost:3000` and render the data table.
